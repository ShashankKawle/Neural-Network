# Neural-Network
This is raw code to create Neural Network without any packages. This Neural Network is based on example where we take length and width of flower and try to predict its color based on information. 

#### Training Data
| Length | Width | Color |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 0.5 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 | 0 |
| 3 | 1.5 | 1 |
| 3.5 | 0.5 | 1 |
| 4 | 1.5 | 1 |
| 5.5 | 1 | 1 |

> 0 = Blue & 1 = Red
